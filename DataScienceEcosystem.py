# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives**
# 
# - List of popular languages
# - List of commonly used libraries by Data Scientist
# - Data Science Tools
# - Arithmetic Expressions
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
#     1. Python
#     2. Julia
#     3. SQL
#     4. Matlab
#     5. C++

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
#     
#     1. Keras
#     2. Pandas
#     3. Numpy
#     4. Scikit learn
#     5. Matplotlib

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# *This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.*

# In[2]:


(3*4)+5


# *This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.*

# In[ ]:


hours = (200/60)
